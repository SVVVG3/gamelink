## Lessons

### Technical Lessons
1. **Database Relationships**: Supabase relationship queries return objects, not arrays - use proper TypeScript casting
2. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Proper cleanup and error handling essential for performance
3. **Farcaster SDK Integration**: Use `sdk.actions.openUrl()` for external links in mini apps
4. **Admin Status Checking**: Leverage existing membership functions for role-based UI features
5. **Interface Design**: Extend existing interfaces rather than creating new ones for consistency

### UX Lessons
1. **Consistent Navigation**: Users expect same interface regardless of entry point
2. **Clickable Elements**: User avatars should be interactive for profile access
3. **Admin Access**: Admin functions should be easily accessible but not cluttered
4. **External Links**: Proper handling crucial for mini app user experience
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show admin options only when relevant and authorized

### Development Workflow
1. **Incremental Testing**: Build and test after each major change
2. **Interface Consistency**: Maintain consistent patterns across components
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for admin status checking
4. **State Management**: Proper cleanup for dropdown menus and modals
5. **Documentation**: Update interfaces and types as features evolve
