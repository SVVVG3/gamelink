## Current Status / Progress Tracking

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (Latest Session)

#### **üí¨ Event Chat UX Improvements - COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- **Issues Addressed**: 
  1. ‚úÖ **Visual Distinction**: Removed "- Event Chat" suffix from titles, added orange "Event" label instead of blue "Group"
  2. ‚úÖ **Share Functionality**: Share button now shares the event (not chat) for event chats using proper event URLs
  3. ‚úÖ **Settings Integration**: Settings button redirects to event page for event chats, group settings for regular groups
  4. ‚úÖ **Leave Chat**: Added leave chat functionality for all users with proper API endpoint
  5. ‚úÖ **Admin Menu**: Updated admin menu with context-aware labels and leave option for everyone
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Added event detection logic using chat name suffix pattern
  - Created `shareEventFrame()` function for event-specific sharing
  - Enhanced admin menu with conditional options based on chat type
  - Implemented `/api/chats/[chatId]/leave` endpoint for leaving chats
  - Added proper event data fetching via `/api/events?chatId=` parameter
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/app/messages/page.tsx` - Event chat visual distinction and labeling
  - `src/app/messages/[chatId]/page.tsx` - Share/settings functionality and leave chat
  - `src/app/api/events/route.ts` - Added chatId filtering support
  - `src/app/api/chats/[chatId]/leave/route.ts` - Leave chat API endpoint
- **Result**: Event chats now have proper visual distinction, functional share/settings buttons, and complete chat management capabilities

#### **üí¨ Event Chat Functionality Implementation**
- **Issue**: Events had no communication channel for participants to coordinate before/during events
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `chat_id` field to events table via database migration
  - Modified event creation API to automatically create group chat when event is created
  - Added "Join Group Chat" button to event details page for registered participants
  - Created `/api/events/[eventId]/join-chat` endpoint for chat participation
  - Updated Event interface and all API endpoints to include `chatId` field
  - Implemented proper RLS policies for event chat access
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `database/migrations/010_add_event_chat_support.sql` (new migration)
  - `src/types/index.ts` (Event interface)
  - `src/app/api/events/route.ts` (event creation with chat)
  - `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/route.ts` (include chatId)
  - `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/join-chat/route.ts` (new endpoint)
  - `src/lib/supabase/events.ts` (include chatId in transformations)
  - `src/app/events/[eventId]/EventDetailsClient.tsx` (Join Group Chat button)

#### **üîß Back Navigation Fix**
- **Issue**: Admin pages (Edit Group, Manage Members) were navigating back to old group details page instead of group chat
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `EditGroupClient.tsx` and `MembersClient.tsx` to use `getOrCreateGroupChat()` function
  - Replaced static links with dynamic navigation buttons
  - Added loading states during navigation
  - Fallback to group details page if chat creation fails
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/app/groups/[groupId]/edit/EditGroupClient.tsx`
  - `src/app/groups/[groupId]/members/MembersClient.tsx`

#### **üéØ Share Functionality Addition**
- **Issue**: Group chat interface was missing Share button that was available on group details page
- **Solution**:
  - Added Share button to group chat header for all group chats
  - Implemented `shareGroupFrame()` function with Farcaster SDK integration
  - Uses `sdk.actions.composeCast()` for mini app context
  - Fallback to Warpcast web interface for standalone usage
  - Fetches group data for rich sharing content
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/messages/[chatId]/page.tsx`

#### **üîÑ Technical Implementation Details**
- **Event Chat Flow**: Event creation ‚Üí Auto-create group chat ‚Üí Link via `chat_id` ‚Üí Participants can join chat
- **Navigation Pattern**: `getOrCreateGroupChat(groupId, userId)` ‚Üí `router.push(/messages/${chatId})`
- **Share Integration**: Farcaster SDK with graceful fallback to web

## Lessons

### Technical Lessons
1. **Navigation Consistency**: Always ensure related features follow the same navigation patterns
2. **Admin UX**: Admin functionality should be accessible from the primary interface, not separate pages
3. **Share Integration**: Farcaster SDK requires proper context detection and fallback handling
4. **State Management**: Loading states are crucial for async navigation operations
5. **Function Reuse**: Existing functions like `getOrCreateGroupChat()` can solve navigation consistency issues

### Development Process
1. **User Feedback**: Screenshots and specific issue descriptions help identify UX problems quickly
2. **Incremental Fixes**: Small, focused changes are easier to test and verify
3. **Build Verification**: Always test compilation after making changes
4. **Documentation**: Keep track of fixes and their reasoning for future reference

### Farcaster Integration
1. **SDK Context**: Always check for mini app context before using SDK features
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Web fallbacks ensure functionality works in all environments
3. **External Links**: Use `sdk.actions.openUrl()` for external navigation in mini apps
4. **Share Content**: Rich sharing content improves user engagement and group discovery
