## Current Status / Progress Tracking

### ✅ Recently Completed (Latest Session)

#### **💬 Event Chat Functionality Implementation**
- **Issue**: Events had no communication channel for participants to coordinate before/during events
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `chat_id` field to events table via database migration
  - Modified event creation API to automatically create group chat when event is created
  - Added "Join Group Chat" button to event details page for registered participants
  - Created `/api/events/[eventId]/join-chat` endpoint for chat participation
  - Updated Event interface and all API endpoints to include `chatId` field
  - Implemented proper RLS policies for event chat access
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `database/migrations/010_add_event_chat_support.sql` (new migration)
  - `src/types/index.ts` (Event interface)
  - `src/app/api/events/route.ts` (event creation with chat)
  - `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/route.ts` (include chatId)
  - `src/app/api/events/[eventId]/join-chat/route.ts` (new endpoint)
  - `src/lib/supabase/events.ts` (include chatId in transformations)
  - `src/app/events/[eventId]/EventDetailsClient.tsx` (Join Group Chat button)

#### **🔧 Back Navigation Fix**
- **Issue**: Admin pages (Edit Group, Manage Members) were navigating back to old group details page instead of group chat
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `EditGroupClient.tsx` and `MembersClient.tsx` to use `getOrCreateGroupChat()` function
  - Replaced static links with dynamic navigation buttons
  - Added loading states during navigation
  - Fallback to group details page if chat creation fails
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/app/groups/[groupId]/edit/EditGroupClient.tsx`
  - `src/app/groups/[groupId]/members/MembersClient.tsx`

#### **🎯 Share Functionality Addition**
- **Issue**: Group chat interface was missing Share button that was available on group details page
- **Solution**:
  - Added Share button to group chat header for all group chats
  - Implemented `shareGroupFrame()` function with Farcaster SDK integration
  - Uses `sdk.actions.composeCast()` for mini app context
  - Fallback to Warpcast web interface for standalone usage
  - Fetches group data for rich sharing content
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/messages/[chatId]/page.tsx`

#### **🔄 Technical Implementation Details**
- **Event Chat Flow**: Event creation → Auto-create group chat → Link via `chat_id` → Participants can join chat
- **Navigation Pattern**: `getOrCreateGroupChat(groupId, userId)` → `router.push(/messages/${chatId})`
- **Share Integration**: Farcaster SDK with graceful fallback to web
- **State Management**: Loading states and error handling for better UX
- **Admin Detection**: Proper role checking for admin functionality visibility
- **Database Schema**: Added proper foreign key relationships and RLS policies for event chats

### 🎯 **Current Focus Areas**
1. **User Experience Optimization**: Ensuring consistent navigation and functionality across all interfaces
2. **Admin Tools**: Comprehensive group and event management capabilities
3. **Social Sharing**: Seamless integration with Farcaster for content sharing
4. **Performance**: Optimizing real-time features and data loading

## Lessons

### Technical Lessons
1. **Navigation Consistency**: Always ensure related features follow the same navigation patterns
2. **Admin UX**: Admin functionality should be accessible from the primary interface, not separate pages
3. **Share Integration**: Farcaster SDK requires proper context detection and fallback handling
4. **State Management**: Loading states are crucial for async navigation operations
5. **Function Reuse**: Existing functions like `getOrCreateGroupChat()` can solve navigation consistency issues

### Development Process
1. **User Feedback**: Screenshots and specific issue descriptions help identify UX problems quickly
2. **Incremental Fixes**: Small, focused changes are easier to test and verify
3. **Build Verification**: Always test compilation after making changes
4. **Documentation**: Keep track of fixes and their reasoning for future reference

### Farcaster Integration
1. **SDK Context**: Always check for mini app context before using SDK features
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Web fallbacks ensure functionality works in all environments
3. **External Links**: Use `sdk.actions.openUrl()` for external navigation in mini apps
4. **Share Content**: Rich sharing content improves user engagement and group discovery
